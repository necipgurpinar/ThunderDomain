# ThunderDomain 

This is my first Unity project that I created on my own, so there may be some mistakes.  

The main purpose of this project was to get used to coding, so it's a small and simple project.  
I wanted to recreate a character skill from a game I like.  

##  Project Goal  
The character is controlled from a **top-down perspective**.  
When the skill is activated, a **special zone** appears beneath the character, and they receive a **speed boost** while inside that zone.  

##  Assets Used  
The asset package I used is **free to use**:  
[ðŸ”— Free Quick Effects Vol.1](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/free-quick-effects-vol-1-304424)  

##  Controls  
- **W, A, S, D** â†’ Move  
- **E** â†’ Activate Skill  

##  Default Settings  
- **Skill Cooldown:** 10 seconds  
- **Skill Duration:** 5 seconds
